## 3. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (VPS)

/docker/n8n/          → n8n (docker-compose)
/docker/n8n/.n8n/     → n8n SQLite database + encryptionKey
/root/supabase/       → Supabase (docker-compose) — THE REAL, ACTIVE STACK
/docker/supabase/     → ORPHANED/STALE stack, do not use — confirmed 2026-07-06 during
                         auth debugging that its secrets no longer match; the live
                         supabase-auth container reads its .env from /root/supabase/

n8n containers:
- n8n_songss — n8n v2.28.3 (stable), port 5678
- n8n-tunnel-n8n-1 — Cloudflare tunnel

Docker networks:
- n8n is connected to supabase_default (to reach supabase-auth:9999)
- Without this connection, Supabase Auth calls fail with DNS error

Automated n8n backup:
/docker/n8n/backup_n8n.sh  → runs every hour via cron
/docker/n8n/backups/        → backup destination (7-day retention)

## 4. NIE FLOW (DO NOT BREAK)

Stripe Webhook (checkout.session.completed)
  → Filter → Extract Metadata (customer_email, session_id, plan_name)
  → Create Supabase User → Generate Welcome Link → Send Welcome Email
  → Insert Intelligence Report → Check Duplicate Session → If
    → Plan Router → Config Haiku or Config Opus
      → [10 data sources: Spotify, Deezer, Last.fm, SoundCloud, MusicBrainz,
         Shazam, TikTok, Genius, Jamendo, Perplexity]
        → NIE Engine (Gemini 2.5 Flash) → Merge → Format HTML
        → Save to Supabase → Send Report Email → Save Processed Session

Submit Trigger (POST /webhook/submit-analysis)
  → Validate session_id → Update Artist Name → Fetch Session → continue NIE flow

Active workflow: Songss | NIE V4.2 SEQUENTIAL (05-05) — Published
ID: 8SRNZDEpZKu88qFz (corrected 2026-07-06 — the previously recorded ID
    QH6GH3i8TQD75Glp is stale/wrong, confirmed via `docker exec n8n_songss
    n8n list:workflow`; verify against that command if it drifts again)

Note: this same workflow also has a second webhook trigger, "Submit Trigger"
at POST /webhook/submit-analysis, used by the app's /submit page after checkout
to kick off the actual NIE report generation (Update Artist Name → Fetch
Session Data → Submit Context → Plan Router → NIE engine).

KNOWN DOC GAP: the "Insert Intelligence Report → Check Duplicate Session → If"
step above does not reflect live wiring. The "Check Duplicate Session" node
exists in the workflow but has zero inbound connections — confirmed disconnected
in every backup on file, including the earliest one predating all remediation
work (2026-07-07 14:05, before any Claude Code session touched this workflow).
Its original purpose is unknown (Gilberto doesn't recall it either); by its
query shape (filters processed_sessions by Extract Metadata's session_id, on
the Stripe-webhook Phase 1 path) it looks like it was meant to catch duplicate
Stripe webhook deliveries, but this is inferred, not confirmed. As of
2026-07-09 its hardcoded Supabase JWT was migrated to the shared
"Supabase Service Role Auth" credential for security, but it was deliberately
left disconnected rather than rewired — not confident enough in intent to
reconnect without risking a behavior change. Live duplicate-Stripe-webhook
protection may not currently exist at all; worth deciding whether that's a
real gap to fix or dead code to remove.

KNOWN SECURITY GAP (found 2026-07-09, not yet fixed): the "Stripe Webhook"
node has no signature verification. The "Filter" node immediately downstream
only checks `body.type === "checkout.session.completed"` — a plain string
match on the JSON body, not an HMAC/signature check. No `stripeApi` credential
exists anywhere in this n8n instance and no `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var is
set. Practical effect: anything that can reach POST /webhook/stripe-webhook
with the right JSON shape triggers the full chain (real Supabase Auth user
creation, real welcome email, real intelligence_reports row) — Stripe's own
signature is not required or checked. Not fixed yet; flagged for a future
dedicated session, same category as the Check Duplicate Session gap above.

RESOLVED BUG (found and fixed 2026-07-14): the "Spotify Search" node
(`httpRequest` → Apify `automation-lab~spotify-scraper`, `mode:"search"`) read
its search term as bare `{{ $json.artist_name }}` — i.e. from its immediate
predecessor node's output only. That predecessor is "YouTube" (an
`httpRequest` call to yt-api.p.rapidapi.com), which replaces `$json` entirely
with the RapidAPI response and carries no `artist_name` field. So the actual
search term sent to Apify was always empty/undefined, Apify correctly
returned zero matches, and `alwaysOutputData: true` silently emitted `{}`
instead of erroring — meaning Spotify data (and everything downstream that
depends on it, including the Peer Benchmark feature added the same day) had
never worked, for any artist, including historically-"successful" runs.
Confirmed via an isolated Apify call outside n8n (same URL/params, real data
returned) that Apify itself was never the problem. Every sibling data-source
node (Deezer, Last.fm, MusicBrainz, Shazam, Genius, Jamendo, SoundCloud)
already used the correct pattern — a fallback chain reading
`$('Extract Metadata').first().json.artist_name` then
`$('Submit Context').first().json.artist_name` — "Spotify Search" was the
only node using the bare, wrong reference. Fixed by applying the same
fallback-chain expression, deployed across all 3 DB locations
(`workflow_entity.nodes` + both `workflow_history` rows), restarted, and
export-diff confirmed only this node's `jsonBody` changed. Live-tested via
an isolated Submit Trigger run (artist "Clairo"): real Spotify data and a
real, non-empty Peer Benchmark peer list both confirmed working end-to-end.
The 4 public landing-page sample reports (see `src/lib/sampleReports.ts`)
predated this fix and had empty/zero Spotify data and `NULL`
`peer_benchmark_data`; all 4 were regenerated in place the same day and now
show real data.

RESOLVED (verified 2026-07-17): the TikTok/Instagram username-resolution
fallback fix from 2026-07-07 (try/catch chain reading Config Haiku then
Config Opus for `tiktok_username`/`instagram_username`) is confirmed live and
working — real Instagram data (real follower counts) now flows through end
to end via an isolated Submit Trigger test.

KNOWN BUG (found 2026-07-17, not fixed): n8n intermittently fails to write
the final `execution_entity.status`/`stoppedAt` for this workflow, even when
every node — including the last one — records `executionStatus: success` and
real downstream Postgres writes (the `intelligence_reports` row,
`processed_sessions` row) demonstrably happened. Reproduced twice in one
session, once with no client response ever arriving and once with a normal
fast `{"status":"ok"}` response — the finalization gap happens either way.
This is very likely the true nature of the older "hanging execution" bug
tracked during the 2026-07-07 to 2026-07-09 JWT credential migration (see
memory `project_n8n_hanging_execution_bug` / `EXECUTIONS_TIMEOUT=300` and
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS=true`, both still deployed in
docker-compose.yml but confirmed not to fix this): those incidents were only
ever checked at the `execution_entity` level, never cross-checked against
actual Postgres state, so it's unknown whether they were true stalls or the
same finalization bug. Practical impact so far: real work completes and
persists correctly; only n8n's own execution history/status tracking is
wrong. Root cause not yet investigated (candidate: something in the
`EXECUTIONS_DATA_SAVE_ON_PROGRESS` write path — the only log line ever seen
near a hang is a "Custom data value over 512 characters long. Truncating..."
warning, timestamped right around when the real DB write happens — this is a
correlation, not a proven cause). Flagged for a future dedicated session.

## 5. SUPABASE DATABASE

Tables:
- intelligence_reports (session_id, customer_email, artist_name, plan_name,
  report_html, report_markdown, geo_hotspots, engagement_metrics, user_id)
- teams (owner_user_id, member_user_id) — seats for Growth+ plans

RPC SECURITY DEFINER:
- get_report_by_session(p_session_id text) — always use this, never direct SELECT

Public view:
- public_geo_hotspots (geo_hotspots, created_at) — for NeuralWorldMap component

RLS: enabled. Direct reads on intelligence_reports blocked for anon. Always use RPC.

---

## 6. AUTHENTICATION

- Supabase Auth at supabase-auth:9999 (internal Docker)
- Users created by n8n after Stripe payment
- Initial password = Stripe session_id
- n8n encryptionKey: DO NOT CHANGE — stored in /docker/n8n/.n8n/config
- Key value: see /docker/n8n/.n8n/config on VPS (never commit this value)

---
